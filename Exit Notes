## Current issues
- [x] Contact Form html file has an header and i'm ot able to select the header id to just change it within indivual pages where i would need to.
    - works in console lets try to use an event listener to wait until the dom is loaded fully.



## Next Tasks
- [ ] Refactor JS for Performance
    - [ ] Use Currying so the hero.js and the project.js can use less resources 
        note: they both fundamentally do the same task: load data, load includes file, select container, fill container using data file.
    - [ ] ensure that the .load method is the best practice for this case. could use '.dev comunity' for this, along with other popular software development sites.
