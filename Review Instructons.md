# Review Instructions 

## For Reviewers / Testers 
    this is a website file containing the website in its development stage, don't run any script outside of JS and especially within the 'external scripts' folder as some of the scripts are meant for my computers alone and will download technologies and templates that will be unnecessary for you and potentially use your computer resources (processing power, memory, and storage). 
    ***as a Reviewer / Tester your main goal is to look at the contents of the loaded sites and inform me of any inconsistencies or typos, anything that would make you leave the site displeased. *** Also of course any bugs that breaks the website, currently this has no styling as I'm in the first stage of this so don't worry about artistic aspects right now.

### Steps 
    1. extract zip file in a memorable location on your computer
    2. open the 'index.html' file in the root folder, don't open any from the 'projects' folder
    3. navigate through each page and notify me of any flaws or bugs, besides the contact form as it won't work on your local system without the installation of node.js. 
    4. email, or call me to inform me of your thoughts. 


## For Developers 
    this is a portfolio website project, i've used data files to handle both my projects and my hero sections. in the future i plan to use currying to make more of my code reusable and optimized for performance but currently i'm making sure i have everything working how it's supposed to in every applicable case.  

    though i would be more than happy if you could inform me of bad practices or any suggested refactors.

### Steps
    1. extract zip file
    2. open root html file
    3. explore the website
    4. explore the code base
