        Web Developer with a background in automotive maintenance and a strong

        has been driven by a desire to create responsive and engaging user
        experiences. With hands-on experience in developing small to
        medium-sized web projects, I am constantly learning and evolving my

            With a hands-on approach, I have developed skills in both web
            development and automotive maintenance. I am pursuing an Associate of
            Applied Science at Johnson County Community College, with coursework in
            web development and automotive repair. I am dedicated to continuous
            learning and applying my knowledge to real-world scenarios.
